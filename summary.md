### What I accomplised
I did all the functionality of this project except nav bar and add button.

### What I could have improved
I could have improve the buy functionality. I would like to be able to pass the data to another page. 
Also I would like to change the location of the add button to be on the top for easy access by user.


### Summary
I learned how to collabarate with other teammates. It is a good experience that I can apply to my real dev job. 
I learned what my strengths and weaknesses are.
